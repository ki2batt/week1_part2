    <p>
      My name is Kiki Batterson and I am very happy to be in this course. Other than computer programming my  interests are in music and outdoor activities. As for music I enjoy listening to a variety of different genres. I also play instruments such as the drums, guitar, and piano. And, as for outdoor activties I enjoy hiking, practically any water sport, camping, rockclimbing, and playing soccer. The computer I am coding on is a Windows PC Acer laptop.

    <p>My trouble getting my local host environment running had to do with getting 'grunt' up and running. I resolved the issue by googling the error message the platform-ide terminal displayed & applied a solution a developer on Stack Overflow shared, which was to type in the command on the Windows 10 command prompt: npm install -g grunt-cli, and it worked!
